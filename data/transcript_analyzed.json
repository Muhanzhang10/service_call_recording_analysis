So let's start off with the like for like we always come with our guarantees. We have some really, really excellent guarantees that really just show you that we're going to do a great job for you. We then start off with our first cost. This is a newest nest thermostat. We can switch this up. I just wanted to just simplify it, put something in that you guys are used to. It will be just the most modern version. And then we credit this back towards replacement at the very end. So this 549 will be credited back towards you. Then we talk about steps like what we need to do. AC removal, hall away and disposal, heater and removal. This is a really lengthy section. This is like typically roughly one day, this amount of work we remove, safely, demolish and dispose of your furnace, remove safely, remove the refrigerant, demolish and dispose of your ac.

So we love to do HERS tests. But in order for us to feel confident in doing that, we would need to do a little bit with your ducting or consider modifying it. What that would look like is something. We do have a promotion going on currently is sealing your ductwork, which just means no replacement. But we go to every single connection and seal it thoroughly and then we can include a test. If we do that next. This is the total cost of four R&E discounts. I do have a fair amount of discounts that I've included. This is again the like for like option. And just to explain what it comes with, I explained R410A. The refrigerant got phased out. We have the newest style here, R32. This is basically just the new standard for refrigerant. It is considered to be better for the environment. It's just much less harmful to ozone layers in general. 35% cooling savings, 30% heating savings. It is going to be the same similar type of technology. The sear rating is up. You currently have a 12 seer. We install a 15 and then we always include standard filtration for you as basic. The motor is an improvement. So the fan motor inside of the system is an improvement. Way more reliable and way quieter. That's basically what this comes with now. A really cool thing. 10 year manufacturer warranty, 10 year compressor warranties. If you're on this maintenance program with us, we actually completely match the manufacturer warranties. It's essentially 10 years parts and 10 year manufacturer warranty. And then moving on, we'll just get to the first heat pump. Really very similar line items. I'm not going to go through every single one this time. I wanted to pause at this one though. The technology we're talking about with this heat pump is called an inverter. Have you ever heard of an inverter before?",

This one we have that same type of inverter technology where it ramps up and ramps down, except we're just attaching it to the ductwork. So the main difference here just important to realize that it's going to heat and cool a little bit differently. In general, everything is going to be an improvement. Cooling will be significantly better. Usually we're talking like 60% utility bill savings. The thing about heating side, it's just important to note usually they don't absolutely kill it the same way old furnaces do. Old furnaces have flames. So obviously we're going to get really intense temperature coming out. These do heat a little bit less extreme, but still are totally capable of.",

So we like to install them. But what's interesting is Bryant does have a corner on a type of technology. Heat pumps, on occasion, enter a defrost cycle, which is where it briefly stops heating and it just runs itself alone to heat itself back up. These are known to not really enter that.

So when an airflow is pulled in and it does this, that naturally creates noise. We can install an egg carton version that has a square squares instead. And it's much, much, much, much better for airflow. And when that happens, it makes it a lot quieter, too. I did do a test one time on no change other than the grill, and it did decrease noise by 20% when I did that. So 20% quieter, it would still get on the noise. Not. It would be much less noisy than this. But if we did do the basic furnace, that's not going to be as quiet. But if we talk about inverters, those actually can sometimes be hard, at least even on type of thing. Do you even hear it running?",
