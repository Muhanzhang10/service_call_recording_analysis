So we love to do HERS tests. But in order for us to feel confident in doing that, we would need to do a little bit with your ducting or consider modifying it. What that would look like is something. We do have a promotion going on currently is sealing your ductwork, which just means no replacement. But we go to every single connection and seal it thoroughly and then we can include a test. If we do that next. This is the total cost of four R&E discounts. I do have a fair amount of discounts that I've included. This is again the like for like option. And just to explain what it comes with, I explained R410A. The refrigerant got phased out. We have the newest style here, R32. This is basically just the new standard for refrigerant. It is considered to be better for the environment. It's just much less harmful to ozone layers in general. 35% cooling savings, 30% heating savings. It is going to be the same similar type of technology. The sear rating is up. You currently have a 12 seer. We install a 15 and then we always include standard filtration for you as basic. The motor is an improvement. So the fan motor inside of the system is an improvement. Way more reliable and way quieter. That's basically what this comes with now. A really cool thing. 10 year manufacturer warranty, 10 year compressor warranties. If you're on this maintenance program with us, we actually completely match the manufacturer warranties. It's essentially 10 years parts and 10 year manufacturer warranty. And then moving on, we'll just get to the first heat pump. Really very similar line items. I'm not going to go through every single one this time. I wanted to pause at this one though. The technology we're talking about with this heat pump is called an inverter.

So the main difference here just important to realize that it's going to heat and cool a little bit differently. In general, everything is going to be an improvement. Cooling will be significantly better. Usually we're talking like 60% utility bill savings. The thing about heating side, it's just important to note usually they don't absolutely kill it the same way old furnaces do. Old furnaces have flames.

Daikin we love to work with because they really like us. If you ever look up daikin products on Google and you look up, like, install videos, you'll actually see my company installing them because we do the worldwide training for how to install daikin, so we just have a great partnership with them. So we like to install them. But what's interesting is Bryant does have a corner on a type of technology. Heat pumps, on occasion, enter a defrost cycle, which is where it briefly stops heating and it just runs itself alone to heat itself back up. These are known to not really enter that. And the brilliant. And it's just because of the way their coils are built. They have a better type of metal derivative in it that is better at dissipating its own heat and keeping itself warm.",
